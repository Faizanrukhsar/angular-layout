Angular Layout
==============

Angular Layout is a collection of directives written in [angular][2], to
simplify building of full-page layouts. It is inspired by Apache Flex (formerly
Adobe Flex) way of defining layout by means of declarative xml elements and
related attributes.

This library, although very simple, is experimental and has not yet been tested
extensively. Please provide feedback if you notice a bug or misbehavior, and,
anyway, **use at your own peril.**

The main target of this library are mobile devices and modern browsers, old
versions of IE are not taken into account at the current stage of development.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install Angular Layout is using [bower][1]. If you haven't
tried it yet give it a shot, maybe by trying out the awesome [ng-boilerplate][3]
for your next project.

Usage
-----

Add the module *ng.layout* to your application dependencies, like so:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
angular.module('myApp', ['ng.layout', ...])
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Don't forget to refer angular-layout.js and angular-layout.css in your page.

Look at the [demos][4] for some usage examples (more to come).
